    "# WRDS \"last updated\" metadata and parquet files\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently, WRDS has made two changes to the data in its PostgreSQL database.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first change is that several tables have been updated with the correct data types.\n",
    "For example, `permno` and `permco` are now integers in `crsp.dsf`.\n",
    "As a result, on no longer needs to specify `col_types={'lpermno': 'int32', 'lpermco': 'int32'}` when running `wrds_update_pq('dsf', 'crsp')`.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, not every field has received this update.\n",
    "In `crsp.ccmxpf_lnkhist`, `lpermno` and `lpermco` are not integers, so the need to specify `col_types` still applies to that table.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second change is that **comments** have been added to the WRDS tables that provide information about the last update for that table.\n",
    "When I created `db2pq`, no information about the date of the last update was stored in the database.\n",
    "To address this, in `wrds_update_pq()`, I ran a `PROC CONTENTS` on the SAS data file and extracted the \"last updated\" information from that.\n",
    "Assuming that the SAS data and the PostgreSQL data would be in sync, I stored the SAS \"last updated\" information in the metadata for the parquet file created from the PostgreSQL data.\n",
    "Now that similar information is stored in the WRDS tables, I no longer need to call SAS behind the scenes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The latest version of `db2pq` (version 0.1.4) uses the PostgreSQL update information by default.\n",
    "One side-effect of this switch is that it you run `wrds_update_pq()` for a parquet file you already have, it will detect the *change* in the last-updated data and proceed to update, even if no change in the data has occurred.\n",
    "To avoid this, you can specify `use_sas=True` when calling `wrds_update_pq()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another change in version 0.1.4 of `db2pq` is the addition of the function `pq_last_updated()` to extract \"last updated\" metadata from a parquet data repository.\n",
    "This can be useful for **data version control** for WRDS data.\n",
    "WRDS does not appear to provide any archived vintages of its data sets, so it is up to users to put aside versions of WRDS data to match what was used in analysis (e.g., to ensure reproducibility of a published paper, or even to ensure that results from a few months ago hold up).\n",
    "\n",
    "The WRDS web query interface is problematic from the point of view of reproducibility, as it is too easy to lose the details of the query used to produce the data and of the vintage of the underlying table.\n",
    "If you're a SAS user, you can grab `dsf.sas7bdat` from the relevant directory under `crsp`.\n",
    "But otherwise things have been more difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this regard, there's a lot of merit in using `wrds_update_pq()` to get WRDS data in a compact, easy-to-use form (i.e., parquet files).\n",
    "Each parquet file produced by `wrds_update_pq()` comes with \"last updated\" metadata, previously from SAS files and now from the PostgreSQL database.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code below, before I update the data I downloaded recently, I apply `pq_last_updated()` to the repository, then update it, then apply again.\n",
    "The results can be seen below."
