    "# Creating a parquet data repository from WRDS data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The parquet data format is something like the modern CSV file.\n",
    "Like the CSV file, a parquet file can be read by any modern data analysis software.\n",
    "Unlike CSV files, parquet files include metadata about the data contained therein, including information on data types and index information for quick access to data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For WRDS data, a parquet repository along the lines discussed [here](https://iangow.github.io/far_book/parquet-wrds.html) greatly facilitates replicability.\n",
    "In [*Empirical Research in Accounting: Tools and Methods*](https://iangow.github.io/far_book/), every single analysis can be run by readers with either access to the WRDS PostgreSQL database or with a local repository of parquet data files.\n",
    "The changes to the code needed to switch from the WRDS PostgreSQL database to with a local parquet repository are minimal and, in any case, are provided as alternative tabs in the online version of the book (see [here](https://iangow.github.io/far_book/bb68.html#replicating-ball1968ub), for example).\n",
    "\n",
    "While this note focuses on getting the WRDS data needed to run every analysis in  *Empirical Research in Accounting: Tools and Methods*, the `db2pq` package should allow you to get local parquet versions of *any* data set found in the WRDS PostgreSQL database.\n",
    "(If you find that `db2pq` doesn't work with a data set of interest to you, just file an \"issue\" in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/iangow/db2pq/issues).)\n",
    "\n",
    "A later note will show how the data repository created here can be used to run analyses found in [*Empirical Research in Accounting: Tools and Methods*](https://iangow.github.io/far_book/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting WRDS data for *Empirical Research in Accounting: Tools and Methods*\n",
    "\n",
    "To use this notebook, you should have Python installed along with some way of running the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install Python. I use a very generic setup offered by the click-installable package found at [`python.org`](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n",
    "2. Run additional installation scripts. The Python installation above comes with two scripts: `Install Certificates.command` and `Update Shell Profile.command`.\n",
    "3. Install required packages.\n",
    "Here I open a new Terminal window and check that `pip3` points to the Python I just installed:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "igow@mac-mini ~ % which pip3                    \n",
    "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.14/bin/pip3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip3 install jupyterlab db2pq\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Open JupyterLab.\n",
    "I do this from the Terminal app on my Mac mini.\n",
    "I first change the directory (using `cd`) to the place where I have put this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "igow@mac-mini ~ % cd ~/git/far_templates \n",
    "igow@mac-mini far_templates % jupyter-lab\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Open this notebook.\n",
    "I can see `get_wrds_data.ipynb` in the file navigator pane in JupyterLab and can open it by double-clicking on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Run this notebook. Perhaps the cleanest approach is to select \"Restart Kernel and Run All Cells...\" from the \"Kernel\" menu at the top of JupyterLab's interface."
